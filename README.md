This project sprang from two friends eager to delve into game development. It’s a 2D platformer inspired by Jump King—but inverted: instead of climbing up, you’re racing downward. 
You play as a humble skeleton with oversized arms who has just kidnapped the princess on behalf of the devil. 
Now you must descend as quickly as possible without letting the Knight (your relentless adversary) catch you. 
Using your massive arms, you carefully climb down each ledge while keeping the princess unconscious—if she wakes and struggles, she could cause you to slip and lose all your progress.
